# halima_2

This read me contains my reason for choosing this project.

I created a simple playlist website that lets the visitor play the theme song of my top four showsof all time. 
growing up a queer nigerian and knowing from when you are 7 that you can't feel certain ways is the literal definition of being closeted 
ATLA or the general avatar commuinty was the first to let me know it was fine.
i got a little older and then came Steven Universe, at 13 I was over joyed 
Then came She-ra and the princesses of power which unlike other shows let you know they support the lgbt+ commuity 
and finally The owl house which still runs.

My hope is to eventually expand this project to build a full parallax website for deciding which queer supportive cartoons are available and kid friendly.
