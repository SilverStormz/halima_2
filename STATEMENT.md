This file contains my techinical how.

I had so many problems with finishing this which was really just a result of learnung muliple languages and softwares at once. 

processing java requires the media to be put in a seprate folder but js/html requires it be in the same. I had my media in a seprate folder and spent hours and about 6 versions 
trying to understand why it was not running till i eventually had to simplyfy the code down. 

All media used in the project are from outside resources which i would link down below
